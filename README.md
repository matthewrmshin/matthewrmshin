### About Matt

Hi there, I am an Expert Scientific Software Engineer at the Met Office's
Weather Science Research To Operation group.

2021/now: I am currently working on improving the user experience in managing
and working with large workflow suites for the next generation modelling
systems. I am currently looking to:

- Modularise YAML configuration files associated with JSON schemas.
- Generate JSON schema from C++ applications.
- Manage and organise application configurations in workflow suites.
- Manage versioning of run time configurations in a rapid development environment.
- Create useful form-based UI for YAML configuration files with JSON schemas.
- Develop a user experience vision for working with NWP workflow suites and a
  roadmap to implement the vision.

2019/2021: In my previous role at the Met Office's Business Group Post
Processing Application team, I worked on modernising some of our Post
Processing applications, which included:

- Developing a workflow suite to allow scientists to trial different new
  post-processing applications and techniques with many years of data.
- Proposing and demonstrating how to migrate an existing post processing
  workflow from running on-premise to running in a serverless architecture on
  AWS, to reduce cost and increase flexibility.
- Removing bottlenecks in various application logic to enable an on-demand API
  that triggered post processing applications in the backend.

2022-2019: Before that, I was in the Met Office's Weather Science IT group,
where I worked on:

- A system to manage configuration for model application runtime, which provided
  our scientists with a common environment and a common set of toolkits to work
  on and manage their model configurations for robust reproducibility.
- A workflow scheduling system, which provided our scientists, engineers and
  system analysts a common environment to run workflow suites to submit jobs on
  our HPC and other computing infrastructure, from simple workflows to complex
  cycling workflows and from research to operation.
- A fully featured build system for modern Fortran applications, which provided
  our scientists with a very efficient environment to compile their code
  (compared to a traditional `Makefile` environment) and to reproduce build
  configurations.
- The software layer of our massive archive system, providing our users with
  a common interface to access our massive archive system.
- An application to convert the format of some data files, handling fragments of
  data files and complex platform specific issues.
- And so on.

In summary, I have over 20 years of software development/engineering experience
in a variety of programming languages including Python, Perl, Java, Fortran, C,
C++, Bash, JavaScript, etc. I am currently most comfortable working with Python
in a Linux/Unix environment.

I joined the Met Office in 2002. I studied Material Science at Trinity College,
University of Oxford. I gained a DPhil (aka PhD) in 2002 and an MEng (1st Class
Honour) in 1998.
