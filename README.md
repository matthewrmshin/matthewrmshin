# About Matt

I have led and contributed to various software development and lifecycle
management activities since starting my career at the Met Office in 2002.
My main interests are in workflow automation and configuration management, for
building and running mission critical scientific applications on HPC, Linux
clusters, and the Cloud.  I enjoy helping colleagues to reduce complexity in
their software. My work is used in both research and production locally and by
international partners. I have varying level of experience in a variety of
programming languages including Python, Perl, Java, Fortran, C, C++, Bash,
JavaScript and SQL.

I am always ready for some new challenges.

## Professional Experience

### 2021 to now

*Expert Scientific Software Engineer,
Weather Science Research To Operations, Met Office.*

Improving the user experience in managing and working with large workflow suites
for the next generation modelling systems for research to operational use.
I am advising developers and users on how to modularise large model application
configuration files, using a
[YAML processor](https://github.com/JCSDA-internal/yamlprocessor) application
I created and maintain. I am contributing to C++ applications so they can
generate configuration schema files, which can be used to provide validation
services and IDE integration. I am contributing to the release/deployment of the
next generation model applications that are built from many projects under
active development by several partner organisations.

### 2019 to 2021

*Expert Scientific Software Engineer,
Business Group Post Processing Applications, Met Office.*

I led the development of a workflow suite to allow scientists to trial different
new post-processing applications and techniques with many years of data.
The success of this work allowed our scientists to study new ways to deliver
new science capabilities to our customers.

I proposed and demonstrated how to migrate an existing post processing workflow
from running on-premises to running in a serverless architecture on AWS, to
reduce cost and increase flexibility. I developed a prototype that would
automate building, infrastructure creation, and launching the workflow on the fly.

I removed bottlenecks in various application logic to enable on-demand API to
trigger post processing applications in the backend, reducing the overall
runtime from minutes to a few seconds.

### 2002 to 2019

*Expert Scientific Software Engineer,*  
*Senior Scientific Software Engineer,*  
*NWP Applications Developer, Weather Science IT, Met Office.*

I led the design, development, and lifecycle management of
[metomi/rose](https://github.com/metomi/rose/), a system to manage configuration
for model application runtime. It provided our scientists with a common
environment and a common set of toolkits to work on and manage their model
configurations for robust reproducibility. The system has been in use
operationally for many years.

I led and coordinated the development and lifecycle management of
[cylc/cylc-flow](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/), a workflow scheduling
system, which provided our scientists, engineers, and system analysts a
common environment to run workflow suites to submit jobs on the HPC and
other computing resources, from simple workflows to complex cycling
workflows and from research to operation. This workflow scheduling system
has been used by all Met Office core forecasting workflow suites for many years.

I led the design, development, and lifecycle management of
[metomi/fcm](https://github.com/metomi/fcm/), a wrapper to Subversion and a
fully featured build system for modern Fortran applications. The latter
provided our scientists with a very efficient environment to compile their
code (compared to a traditional Makefile environment) and to reproduce
build configurations. Its introduction has reduced build time of some of
our largest science applications from hours to a few minutes. I wrote this
system over a decade ago and it is still in use today for building our
largest science model applications due to its efficiency and effectiveness.

I contributed to the design and development of MOOSE, the software layer
of the Met Office massive archive system, providing users with a common
interface to archive and access data. I contributed to the design of the
client-server interaction and implemented the client logic. The software
is still in production use after 15 years.

I ported software systems across several generations of HPC and Linux/Unix
clusters, some of which have very different architectures and operating systems.
