### About Matt

Hi there, I am an Expert Scientific Software Engineer at the Met Office's
Weather Science Research To Operation group.

2021/now: I am currently working on improving the user experience in managing
and working with large workflow suites for the next generation modelling
systems for research to operational use. Some example recent activities:

- I adviced developers and users on how to modularise large model application
  configuration files, using a YAML processor application I have quickly put
  together.
  See [JCSDA-internal/yamlprocessor](https://github.com/JCSDA-internal/yamlprocessor/).
- I have contributed to C++ model applications to allow them to generate
  configuration schema files at build time.
- I am investigating how to effectively manage releases of large C++ model applications
  that are built from many active projects that are under development by a
  number of partner organisations.
- I am providing advice to scientists on how to manage and organise
  application configurations in workflow suites.
- I am looking at how to manage versioning of run time configurations in a
  rapid development environment.
- I am looking at how to create useful form-based UI for application
  configuration files with schemas with our workflow engine's UI environment.
- I have developed a user experience vision for working with meteorological
  workflow suites and a roadmap to implement the vision. The vision helps to
  drive the conversation with management and stakeholders on how to resourcing
  and prioritisation in the future.

2019/2021: In my previous role at the Met Office's Business Group Post
Processing Application team, I worked on modernising some of our Post
Processing applications.

- I led the development of a workflow suite to allow scientists to trial
  different new post-processing applications and techniques with many years of
  data. The success of this work allowed our scientists to study new ways to
  deliver new science capabilities to our customers.
- I proposed and demonstrated how to migrate an existing post processing
  workflow from running on-premise to running in a serverless architecture on
  AWS, to reduce cost and increase flexibility.
- I removed bottlenecks in various application logic to enable an on-demand API
  that triggered post processing applications in the backend.
- I adviced our scientists on best practice for scientific software development
  flow, and helped them solve everyday's software development problems.

2002/2019: Before that, I was in the Met Office's Weather Science IT group,
where I worked on, led and coordinated many of the activities that are core to
Met Office's science IT capabilities, including:

- A system to manage configuration for model application runtime, which provided
  our scientists with a common environment and a common set of toolkits to work
  on and manage their model configurations for robust reproducibility. This
  system has been in use operationally for many years. I led the
  original design, development and deployment of this system since the
  beginning. See [metomi/rose](https://github.com/metomi/rose/).
- A workflow scheduling system, which provided our scientists, engineers and
  system analysts a common environment to run workflow suites to submit jobs on
  our HPC and other computing infrastructure, from simple workflows to complex
  cycling workflows and from research to operation. This workflow scheduling
  system is used by all of Met Office core forecasting workflow suites for
  many years. I led and coordinated its development, release and
  on-premises deployment from the beginning.
  See [cylc/cylc-flow](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/).
- A fully featured build system for modern Fortran applications, which provided
  our scientists with a very efficient environment to compile their code
  (compared to a traditional `Makefile` environment) and to reproduce build
  configurations. Its introduction has reduced build time of some of our
  largest science applications from hours to a few minutes. I wrote this system
  over a decade ago and it is still in use today for building our largest
  science model applications due to its efficiency and effectiveness.
  See [metomi/fcm](https://github.com/metomi/fcm/).
- The software layer of our massive archive system, providing our users with
  a common interface to access our massive archive system. I was a highly
  productive member of the team.
- An application to convert the format of some data files, handling fragments of
  data files and complex platform specific issues.
- And so on.

In summary, I have over 20 years of software development/engineering experience
in a variety of programming languages including Python, Perl, Java, Fortran, C,
C++, Bash, JavaScript, SQL, etc. I have led software development activities and have
developed software solutions in different teams for a variety of users, from Met
Office scientists to international partners. I am currently most comfortable
working with Python in a Linux/Unix environment, but
I am always looking out for challenges and opportunities to learn new skills.

I joined the Met Office in 2002. I studied Material Science at Trinity College,
University of Oxford. I gained a DPhil (aka PhD) in 2002 and an MEng (1st Class
Honour) in 1998.
